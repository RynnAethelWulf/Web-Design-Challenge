## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

- A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
</br>

- Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
</br>

- A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
</br>
- A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The table must be a bootstrap table component.
